The Flesch Reading Ease gives a text a score between 1 and 100, with 100 being
the highest readability score. Scoring between 70 to 80 is equivalent to school
grade level 8. This means text should be fairly easy for the average adult to
read.

The formula was developed in the 1940s by Rudolf Flesch. He was a consultant
with the Associated Press, developing methods for improving the readability of
newspapers.

Now, over 70 years later, the Flesch Reading Ease is used by marketers,
research communicators and policy writers, amongst many others. All use it to
help them assess the ease by which a piece of text will be understood and
engaged with.
