# Acronyms

According to Wikipedia, the World Health Organization (WHO) is a specialized agency of the United Nations that is concerned with international public health.

We can now use WHO because it has been defined, but we can't use DAFB because people may not know what it represents. We can use `DAFB` when it's presented as code, though.

We can also use FAQ because it's an exception.
